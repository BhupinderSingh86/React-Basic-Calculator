# React Basic Calculator

This is my first ever React project after learning basics of Vanilla JavaScript (JS), CSS & HTML. I decided it was best to replicate my first ever JS project, that way I had a good understanding and comparison between the two languages and the benefits of using React rather than JS.

Main Learning Points:
-   how to structure a React project
-   Understanding the benefits of React
-   How to create React components with JSX, JavaScript code and rendering them to the App component
-   Learning what are React hooks and how to use them
-   Pro's and Con's of using React in comparison to JavaScript
-   Understanding how to prop drill and destructor props
-   Dumb components (functional components without hooks) can also be called presentational components
-   useState() is asynchronous which can sometimes cause problems!

I'm sure there are lots of improvements that could be made just like when I started with JS but it's a start!

# Improvements

I have added single number buttons (Dumb components for now) on this calculator but they cannot be used for inputting values currently into the input tag, this is what I can implement as an improvement in due course.
